# JavaScript-test-project

These are some of the beginner level project that I have created When I started learning the coding.
So when I started out coding at that time I used to follow tutorial on the internet and by following the tutorial I created these projects. I know these are not too big projects to see our coding skills.But these projects acted as a steeping stones in my career. 

Even if these projects are basic or beginner level but it helped me to understand the coding concept by implementing it on the real time project. It contain three to four projects each project is necessary to clear the some basic concept. So Let's see which are thoseone.

<h3>List of JavaScript basic project:</h3>
<ol>
